When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working in groups or in the public.

*****************************************************************************

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We want one commit per logical change, and we can ensure this if we do this manually.
This may not be the case if Git automatically pulls for you.
